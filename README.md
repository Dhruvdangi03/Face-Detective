**Project Title: FaceDetective**

**Description:**
FaceDetective is a Python-based project leveraging Django, designed to identify and track a specific person's face. Using Face recognition, the system detects the face of the specified person from the provided image within the given video. The detected face is then highlighted by a rectangle around it in the video, which is displayed on a website.

**Features:**
- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes Python libraries for facial recognition to identify a specified person's face within a video.
- **Web Interface:** Integrates Django to provide a user-friendly web interface for uploading the video file and the reference image.
- **Video Playback:** Displays the processed video on a website, highlighting the recognized face by drawing a rectangle around it.
- **Real-time Processing:** Offers real-time or near-real-time face detection and tracking within the video.

**Installation:**
1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facedetective.git
   cd facedetective
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Access the application through a web browser.
2. Upload a video file and an image of the person to be recognized.
3. Trigger the processing, which will detect the specified person's face within the video.
4. Watch the processed video on the website, showing a highlighted rectangle around the recognized face.

**Acknowledgments:**
- This project utilizes various open-source libraries and frameworks for face recognition and video processing.
- Gratitude to the Django community for providing a robust web framework.

**Note:**
For the optimal performance of face recognition, ensure that the reference image provided is clear and directly focuses on the face of the person to be recognized within the video. Additionally, performance may vary based on the size and quality of the video file. Adjustments and optimizations may be required for efficient processing of larger videos.
